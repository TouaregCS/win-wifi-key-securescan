# 游댏 Wi-Fi Keys Tools for Windows

A small utility set for exporting, encrypting, and decrypting saved Wi-Fi passwords on **Windows**.  
It allows secure backup and recovery of Wi-Fi credentials using **strong AES-256 encryption (Fernet)**.

## 游 Security

- The password is never stored!
- Encryption uses:
        - ```PBKDF2HMAC``` (390k iterations, 16B salt)
        - ```AES-256``` (Fernet)
- The output file contains no readable data!
